We are open to take much more implementation, and we are looking to implement a better database of JKs across the world, with updated hours and addresses!

### Here are some of the features we are looking to implement:
- Dua
- Timer for Recitation or Practice
- Recordings of Ginans through multiple sources
- Alternate pronounciation/languages for Ginans
- Timeline of Ismaili/Islamic History Events
- Porting over Ismaili Gnosis Q&A at [Ask Ismaili Gnosis](https://ask.ismailignosis.com/)
