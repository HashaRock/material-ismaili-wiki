# Ginans

## Sourcing
Ginans are mainly from a Ismaili Heritage, which means some may be missing. Please feel free to send in any other waizes, so that they may be hosted for all! Additionally, we are looking to implement all types of recordings for the recitation of these ginans and would love to get any feedback/source that would be best in this case!
